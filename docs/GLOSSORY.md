# Glossory

This glossary hopes to definitively represent the tacit and explicit conventions applied in 
Scikit-learn and its API, while providing a reference for users and contributors. It aims to 
describe the concepts and either detail their corresponding API or link to other relevant 
parts of the documentation which do so. By linking to glossary entries from the API Reference 
and User Guide, we may minimize redundancy and inconsistency.
